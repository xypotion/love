init = whatever

update
- shift screen if needed
- shift hero if needed
- if not shifting (and other stuff) then
  - check for input
	- if direction button pressed then
	  - get target tile & its type
		- if CLEAR then
		  - move hero that direction: shifting=true, set destination tile, set movement countdown ("distance to _"?)
		- ELSE
		  - if collision-type then stop, maybe do sfx (later)
			- else 
			  - if map-move-type then
				- trigger map shift and...
				- move hero far the other direction: shifting=true, set destination tile, set movement countdown

shiftHero
- if not at destination then
  - move character toward destination tile, reduce countdown
- else arrive() (shifting = false, snap to grid, trigger interactions, NOT collisions)

draw = whatever

data notes:

event = {}
event.id = an identifying number, for fetching from master event table
event.type = "warp", "item", "scene", "battle", "shop"?, "seal", uhh...
event.collide = true or false/nil
event.sprite = actually the set of quads for its frames
event.destination = {wy=#,wx=#,my=#,mx=#} (for warping)
event.item = some kinda name/ID of item. low-key for now..., might end up just being "sprite", esp if items are usually in chests outside of battle
event.volatile = can/should be updated when something else happens on the screen. true for switches+doors, etc, false for wandering NPCs, most other stuff

map = {}
map.tiles, map.events, map.mapType (for minimap colors for now)
map.last_arrival_tile = last tile the hero ARRIVED at, for when/if you implement universal fast travel

loading data in the final game: just load EVERYTHING into memory when the game starts?
- yes: item data, sprite/character art
  - obviously: story progress, party data, inventory
- maybe: enemy/item/event art, enemy data, map data
- no: cutscenes, eventSprite data (locations+behavior; load those when maps are loaded)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
next for "quest":

text boxes

pause on a different key? so space can be main interaction

variable zoom, maybe just a toggle between two modes for now (for testing text and stuff)

scenes! maybe named & loaded from script files
- scrolling text boxes
- sprite acting
- no choices yet

loading many maps at once

a menu?? just show map and inventory (!) for now. don't even want to attempt mouse interaction yet (if at all!?)

test on windows :/ just to see how well it works so far
- may need http://love2d.org/wiki/love.window.getPixelScale
* choppy graphics on Leviathan (prob not Love's fault), and DON'T leave highdpi on by default (only shows 1/4 of the game), but it basically works! yayyyy

save points; saving & loading with http://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem (i guess?)

just a little audio?? come on. -_-

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for later:

USB controller interaction? hmmmmmmmmmmmm (what works on Mac?) ~ almost ideal, but... just... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

mouse interaction... at least try it. menus, battles, maybe regular navigation
- maybe if you keep all interfaces and menus confined to the same grid structure, calculating mouse positions and stuff will be easier!
  - just still picturing on-hover tooltips and stuff, which could have more granular interaction, including
- drag and drop for equipment and party arrangement would be ideal but sounds way hard :/

lol, sound

SCRIPTING for:
- event interaction
- map+event loading (in getMap and when starting game)
- cutscenes
- battles
- enemy AI

game states & event loading... need to load correct scripted events for point in game.
idea 1: one different event for each version of the same event
12345678... (points in storyline)
----		event that disappears after point 4
 -----	battle that opens after point 1
 --			person who says one thing...
   --		...but says something different later
-------	event that never goes away BUT has its own flag for when you complete it
idea 2: fewer events, but with more states/logic. maybe just an "appears if" block?
- will events be loaded all at once when game starts, or per screen?
  * either works, but latter is probably better for performance! because every time a game flag changes, you don't want to check and reload ALL events!
	* ah, but former makes a world map full of indicators easier to do
	  - uh, maybe. why not just have the same gamestate flags affect that too?

name entry screens? lol, no idea what to do there

dynamic water border-laying? just lay mostly-transparent coast tiles on top of flat water? 16~64 different water tiles -> 1~4 water tiles + N coast tiles
- maybe not even full tiles: smaller parts instead
- should be easy to write into sprite batches, and performance will barely suffer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
options:

interaction for NPCs, chests, objects, etc: (1) press interact button or (2) just walk into them
hero walk speed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

thinking about scripting/loading is hard! x_x here's an idea that could work:

load map(x,y) -- one at a time! not all at once, although this whole file WILL be loaded into memory at startup
if x = 0
  if y = 0
		tiles = [big square]
		...
	  if score < 100
		  load events a, b, c, generic shut door
	  else 
			load events x, y, z, new open door to ...
		end
	else if y...
	end
else if x... (ALL MAP DATA)
end
* if switch flipped and something on the screen has to change, just reload current map
* could also accomplish with a separate files for each map, but that's probably slower

load event (id) -- just like maps: one at a time, but this whole file is loaded at startup. no prablem.
if id = 0
  return {
		graphics = foo
		collide = bar
		behavior = {
			... (could keep in a separate file, i guess. just 'cause they're gonna be big)
			* if it's just NPC dialogue, maybe just shove a string or three in here. even simple item gifts could go here with a shortcut :) ("got _!")
			* ...but stuff like cutscenes and quests can go in a separate file if you want
			* do the logic HERE if one event has multiple behaviors, not there!
		}
	}
else if id = 1
  return event b
else ... (ALL EVENTS)
end
