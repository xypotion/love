original idea:

1. Add random blocking square to field, count = 0
2. Ensure that there is a path from west side to east side; remove square above and count++ if not
3. Ensure that there is a path from north side to south side ; remove square above and count++ if not
4. If count == 100, stop, otherwise go to step 1. You should have a city now??


improved pseudocode:

field = empty grid
while not done
	count = 0
  propose adding random impassable square to field
	if path from east edge to west edge still exists AND path from north edge to south edge still exists
		accept square
		count = 0
	else
	  reject square
		count++
		if count == 100 (or something)
			done = true
		end
	end
end
print map
